# Hiking Everyday
## This is the project for OSU CS361 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING I 

The main purpose of this piece of software is to give the best choice and necessary information about hiking trails to the user specifically based on the physical fitness level of the user. Ideally, the software would help users to both enjoy their hike and also improve their fitness by going out to the trails that are doable but still challenging and fun! If any of you is familiar with the app called AllTrails, this will be similar but will definitely serve the user even better and more fun!

There are 5 main key features for this web appliction:
1. The app is able to gather the basic information from the user such as age, gender, daily activity level, etc, the factors to estimate users' physical fitness level. Then, the gathered information will be used to estimate the user’s physical fitness level. The app then will provide various set of levels for customer to choose from. 
2. The second feature, the app is able to retrieve all nearby hiking trails information such as name, distance, difficult level (easy, medium, hard), hiking time estimation, and trailhead location and display them as a list.
3. The app also allows the user to interact to enable the “best choice” feature. This will filter the result with the user’s physical fitness level and show only the matched trails. Users can also choose how they want to feel during their hike; “easy and chill”, “best match my fitness level” or “challenge me more!” This will affect the search results based on what the user select.
4. The app can guide user to the trailhead location by clicking the navigation button and bring them to Google Maps.
5. Last, users always want to get well prepared for their hiking by seeing the recommendation on what gears and clothing they should bring and wear. So, the app has the recommendation functionality, which will base on the current season and the type of the selected trail. For example, if the trail has a lot of inclined elevation gain, a hiking pole may be useful.

Update as of Nov. 6th
Nearby trail function is working, user could use current location or input zip code/city to search neaby trails.
